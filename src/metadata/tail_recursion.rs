//! # Tail recursion information
//!
//! Whenever the compiler detects a direct tail-recursive function call it'll insert this metadata.
//! If the libfunc handler decides to use it by setting a return target, the compiler will insert
//! the required instructions to make it really tail-recursive.
//!
//! Directly recursive functions are detected by checking if the current statement is a function
//! call. Indirect recursion is not handled and generates normal recursive code.
//!
//! Next, the compiler check whether those direct recursive calls are in fact tail recursive.
//! Recursive function calls are tail recursive if nothing declared before the function call is used
//! after it. Due to the way Sierra works, this is as simple as checking whether the state is empty
//! after taking the variables sent to the function call from itself.
//!
//! When tail recursion is detected, a counter is added which counts the current recursion depth.
//! The counter being zero means that no recursion has taken place (either because the program
//! hasn't reached the recursion point yet, or because it has completely unwinded already).
//!
//! Every time the recursive function call is invoked, the libfunc builder should increment this
//! counter by one and jump to the recursion target block provided by the meta. This recursion
//! target is provided by the compiler and should point to the beginning of the function and have
//! the same arguments. The function call libfunc builder should then set the return target to a
//! block which jumps to the next libfunc (a standard libfunc builder terminator as in every other
//! libfunc).
//!
//! When the compiler generates the code for a return statement of a tail recursive function, it'll
//! first check whether the depth counter is zero or not. If zero, a normal return statement will be
//! generated since it'd mean our parent frame is a different function. However if the counter is
//! not zero, the counter is decremented by one and a jump to the return target is generated, which
//! will return control to the function call libfunc builder. The builder should then jump to the
//! next libfunc statement as if it were a normal function call.
//!
//! After calling the libfunc builder, the metadata is removed from storage to avoid collisions
//! later on.
//!
//! The same algorithm can be applied multiple times if there are multiple tail-recursive calls
//! within a function. The compiler should create a different depth counter for each recursive call
//! in the function.
